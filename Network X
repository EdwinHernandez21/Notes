NetworkX is a Python package for the creation, manipulation, and study of the structure, dynamics, and functions of complex networks,
    -the created networks can be used in order to determine which direction we can take the user to. 
    -data structures and graphs can be made from nextworkX

Creating a graph:
    import networkx as nx
    G = nx.Graph()

**Never Mind we are not using NetworkX**
