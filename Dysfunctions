5 dysfunctions of a team

1) Absense of Trust: invulnerbility 
2) Fear of Conflict: Artificial harmany
3) Lack of Communication: Ambiguity
4) Avoidence Of Accounability: Low standards
5) Inattention to results: Status and ego

1.The ﬁrst dysfunction is an absence of trust among team members. Essentially, this stems from their unwillingness to be vulnerable within the group. 
Team members who are not genuinely open with one another about their mistakes and weaknesses make it impossible to build a foundation for trust. 

2. This failure to build trust is damaging because it sets the tone for the second dysfunction: fear of conﬂict. Teams that lack trust are incapable 
of engaging in unﬁltered and passionate debate of ideas. Instead, they resort to veiled discussions and guarded comments. 

3. A lack of healthy conﬂict is a problem because it ensures the third dysfunction of a team: lack of commitment. Without having aired their opinions 
in the course of passionate and open debate, team members rarely, if ever, buy in and commit to decisions, though they may feign agreement during meetings. 

4. Because of this lack of real commitment and buy-in, team members develop an avoidance of accountability, the fourth dysfunction. Without committing 
to a clear plan of action, even the most focused and driven people often hesitate to call their peers on actions and behaviors that seem counterproductive to the good of the team. 

5. Failure to hold one another accountable creates an environment where the ﬁfth dysfunction can thrive. Inattention to results occurs when team members 
put their individual needs (such as ego, career development, or recognition) or even the needs of their divisions above the collective goals of the team.
