Software engennerring:  -software is everwhere
    -it's mostly crap
    -it cost all of us an incredible amount of time and therefore expensive

Not a problem:  -it makes a lot of money
    - it's better than digging holes
    - it can be fun

* close source software is like a cathidrol where it takes time and a lot of money to complete
* open source software is like the oposite you create it for yourself, like github
* whats up and we chat are the two biggest messeging apps in the world, whats up was made up by  people and it was sold to fb for billion $

Software is complex:
    - Software is crazy complex, bowing (air plane software) took  people,  huors a week,  weeks per month
    - as time goes by the programs become more complecated some programs take  millions lines of complecated
    - write as a little as code as possible
    - writee as little as code as you can, when we stop writting code than we are done
    - java was originally used for hot top boxes like microwaves and things that would never need an update
    - C++ is a terrible for programming 
    - You cant handle the complexity
    - the magic number seven, plus or minus 2: some limits on our capacity.

    - The human brain can only keep track of 7 things at the time i our active memory
Why 7: - optimized brain capacity because early hunting parties were that big 
    - we need to make sure that the profgram we are writting has 7 or fewer things going on, of there are more than you dont know what is going on
    - we are in about the same level on complexity as small living creatures as mouse, a wow npc has the same iq as a mouse (5)

What's the problem: - Mariner 1, a 500 mil space craft was lost in space before we even got to use it
    - they used a different math symbal and not the correct one and they didn't run test and therefore it became lost
    - Therac 25, a radiation mechine that was made to treat cancer. in 1987 a couple of people was exposed to too much radiation due to a misfunction in the software and killed about 6 people to overduce of radiation
    - Ariane 5, a rocket that was used, used the same code as the ariane 4 and because of this it wasn't up to date and made it explode right after it took off because it was faster and bigger than the ariane 4
    - stuxnet is a computer worm discovered in june 2010 that is belived to have been created by the United States and Israeli agenncies to attack Iran's nuclear facilities. Stuxnet initially spreads via microsoft windows, and targets Siemens industrial control systems
