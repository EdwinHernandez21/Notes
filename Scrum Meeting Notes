            June 10TH Sprint 2

We need start building a maze, recommened to use an array to plan a maze
User Stories: 1) implement commands for the game, move up (north), down (south), Left (west), right (east)
              2) the dev team can provide a maze generated by them
              3) the game will able to generate a maze by it self

Look up/reseach python libraies that build/generate mazes
- python webcite has libraries that we can use
Use network X (from notes) 

Priority: research how to use a command line to perform action commands from user, which make the game interactable.
