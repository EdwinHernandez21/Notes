            June 10TH Sprint 2

We need start building a maze, recommened to use an array to plan a maze
User Stories: 1) implement commands for the game, move up (north), down (south), Left (west), right (east)
              2) the dev team can provide a maze generated by them
              3) the game will able to generate a maze by it self

Look up/reseach python libraies that build/generate mazes
- python webcite has libraries that we can use
Use network X (from notes) 

Priority: research how to use a command line to perform action commands from user, which make the game interactable. 

        June 12th
We should start working on the dictionary, since we dont have the API at least get a head start to the dictionary
Using iherantance of passing a key value and something would happen and it will get called and continuing the game
For the theme of the game we are thinking about doing an escape room, or saw sounding game 
For refrences: -Saw movies
                -Cube movies
                -Horror type game
                -based on actions you will die
                -Horror adventure

These Notes are from Lukes talk about the design/architecure of the game:

-We are creating a game engine so that way if someone else would like to use to make a different game with our draft thye can
- It should go USER ---------> CLI-----------> GE
                    <--------     <----------  | |
                                               | |
                                    (model)  STATE .yml (the game engine will read the yml file and read and sent to the user)
   
    -This is a model view architecure 
    -Smite (subject )
    - We need a read-excel-print-loop formula 

    -the game engine will have a map system that will also have rooms with different items in them that can be interracted by the user
    -the room should be able to tell you if you visted maybe something wont open unless you have a specific item to them 
    -NPC: you may add NPC to the game at your own wil, ex: npc will give you choices that your choice will eithre take you to state 2 or keep you at state one unless a specific task was/is met
                                                ____________
                                                |A1   | R1  |
                                                |_____|_____|
                                                |A2   |R2   |
                                                |_____|_____|
